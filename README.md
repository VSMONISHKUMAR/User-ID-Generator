# User ID Generator

## Overview
The **User ID Generator** is a Java-based application designed to generate unique user IDs by combining user inputs (first name, last name, and birth year). The system ensures that the generated IDs are unique by appending a random number if necessary. This project uses basic Java concepts and utilizes an `ArrayList` to store and track generated IDs for reference.

## Features
- Generates a unique user ID based on the user's first name, last name, and birth year.
- Ensures uniqueness by checking previously generated IDs and appending random numbers if required.
- Easy-to-use interface that allows the user to generate multiple IDs.


## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Libraries**: 
  - `java.util.ArrayList` for storing generated IDs
  - `java.util.Random` for generating random numbers
  - `java.util.Scanner` for taking user inputs
